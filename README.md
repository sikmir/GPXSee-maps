# GPXSee-maps
This repository contains various "local" map source definitions for [GPXSee](http://www.gpxsee.org).
Feel free to contribute your local maps.

## Rules
1. The map works with the latest released GPXSee version.
2. The map validates against the [latest map xsd schema](https://www.gpxsee.org/map/1.6/map.xsd).
3. Using the map data in GPXSee is not prohibited by the map license.

## Map templates
Some maps require API keys or user credentials. Such map definition files have a *tpl* extension
instead of the usual *xml* extension. You must fill in the required info and rename the files
before you can use them in GPXSee.
